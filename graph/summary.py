### üö© **Key Insights:**

1. **Cyclic vs Acyclic Sensitivity:**
   - **Fails on Cyclic Graphs:**  
     - **Topological Sort** and **Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm** are strictly for **acyclic** graphs (DAGs).  
   - **Requires Cycles:**  
     - **Hierholzer‚Äôs Algorithm** works best when cycles exist (Eulerian paths/circuits).  

2. **Negative Cycles:**
   - Algorithms like **Bellman-Ford**, **Johnson‚Äôs**, and **Floyd-Warshall** fail in the presence of **negative weight cycles**.  

3. **Directed vs Undirected:**
   - MST algorithms like **Prim‚Äôs**, **Kruskal‚Äôs**, and **Boruvka‚Äôs** are designed for **undirected graphs**.  
   - Algorithms for **strongly connected components (SCC)**, such as **Tarjan‚Äôs** and **Kosaraju‚Äôs**, are for **directed graphs**.  

4. **Disconnected Graphs:**
   - **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm** may not form an MST if the graph is **disconnected**.  
   - **PageRank** struggles with small or disconnected graphs due to lack of meaningful link structures.  

5. **Flow Algorithms:**
   - **Ford-Fulkerson** and **Edmonds-Karp** have issues with **irrational capacities**, leading to convergence problems.
